/**
 * Customer Service Simulation Program
 * 
 * This program simulates a basic customer service interface for a bank.
 * It allows users to select from a list of services by entering a number.
 * 
 * Services include:
 * 1. Printing account balance, credit score, and card details.
 * 2. Making or canceling a credit or debit card.
 * 3. Displaying FAQs or connecting to a chatbot.
 * 4. Handling balance transfers.
 * 5. Connecting to customer service.
 * 
 * The program uses a switch statement to handle different service options.
